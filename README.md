# This is a repository that I can share resolutions and experiences of some LeetCode problems! ðŸ“™

Each problem has its own `README.md` file that contains my resolution.

You can view the code and read the `README.md` file to understand the logic behind it. ðŸ™‚

I kept my naive solutions that I have done before start to study advanced algorithms. I think is important to show the process of improving! ðŸš€

If you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to open an issue or contact me (realy, I love suggestions)! ðŸ˜‰

This is my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/u/gustanol)
